Dark theme by Macintosh512k


Icons might be different sizes since I used the original icons as a base, but it seems to work fine on my iPhone. To install the icons I used [Icon Themer](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6565/) and my widget app of choice is [Widgy](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/widgy/id1524540481). Don't expect me to add more but feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Macintosh512k_)
